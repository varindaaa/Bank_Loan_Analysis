Tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                            SQL → Data cleaning, aggregation, and complex queries (joins, window functions, CTEs).
Power BI → Interactive dashboards with KPIs, filters, and drilldowns.

Why SQL?
Direct access to raw data → Perform filtering, aggregations, and transformations.
Scalability → Handles large loan datasets efficiently.
Data accuracy → Ensures clean, structured data before visualization.
Complex queries → Joins, window functions, subqueries help extract meaningful loan metrics.

Why Power BI?
Interactive Dashboards → Loan performance can be sliced by region, customer type, loan type, etc.
Visual Storytelling → Converts SQL data into intuitive charts and KPIs for non-technical stakeholders.
Real-Time Connectivity → Can connect directly to databases for live loan performance monitoring.
Ease of Use → Drag-and-drop interface makes dashboard creation quick and business-friendly.
